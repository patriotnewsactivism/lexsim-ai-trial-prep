## API Usage and Costs

This application uses the Google Gemini API. Be aware of:

- **API calls are made per interaction** (document analysis, witness responses, strategy generation, etc.)
- **Live API sessions** (Trial Simulator) use streaming and can consume more tokens
- **Thinking models** (Strategy Room) use extended reasoning and may be more expensive

Monitor your usage at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

## Customization

### Mock Case Templates

The app includes pre-built case templates in `constants.ts`:
- Criminal Defense (DUI, Armed Robbery, Murder)
- Civil Litigation (Slip & Fall, Breach of Contract)
- Civil Rights & Federal (Section 1983, RICO)
- Family Law (Custody Disputes)

These templates are available for practice but won't appear in your case list by default.

### Witness Personalities

Edit `MOCK_WITNESSES` in `constants.ts` to customize witness profiles, credibility scores, and personality traits.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after changing environment variables
- Verify your API key is active at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Microphone Access (Trial Simulator)
- Grant microphone permissions when prompted
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production (required for microphone access)
- Check browser console for audio-related errors

### Build Errors
- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher: `node --version`

## Privacy & Data

- All case data is stored **locally in browser memory** (no backend database)
- Case data is **lost on page refresh** (no persistence implemented)
- API calls send your prompts to Google's Gemini API - review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
