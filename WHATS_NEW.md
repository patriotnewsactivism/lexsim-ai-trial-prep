---

## 🎯 NEW: Game-Changing Features

### 1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Session Recording & History

**The Problem**: Attorneys need to review their practice sessions to improve, but there was no way to record or replay sessions.

**The Solution**: Full session recording with playback and performance analytics!

**What It Does**:
- ✅ **Records audio** during Trial Simulator sessions (using MediaRecorder API)
- ✅ **Captures transcript** of all exchanges (you + AI)
- ✅ **Tracks performance metrics**:
  - Objections received
  - Fallacies committed
  - Average rhetorical score
  - Word count
  - Filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- ✅ **Calculates overall score** (0-100) based on performance
- ✅ **Generates AI feedback** tailored to your performance
- ✅ **Playback audio** with scrubbing
- ✅ **Export transcripts** as text files
- ✅ **Filter by case** to track improvement over time

**How to Use**:
1. Go to **Trial Simulator**
2. Complete a practice session (speak for at least 30 seconds)
3. Click **Stop** - session saves automatically
4. Go to **Session History** (new sidebar menu item)
5. Click any session to review audio + transcript + score
6. Download transcript or delete sessions

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Score Algorithm**:
  - 50% Rhetorical Effectiveness (from AI coaching)
  - 30% Objection Avoidance (fewer = better)
  - 20% Logical Soundness (fewer fallacies = better)

**Files Created**:
- `components/SessionHistory.tsx` - Full playback UI
- `types.ts` - Added `TrialSession` interface
- Modified `ArgumentPractice.tsx` - Added recording logic

### 2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mock Jury Simulation (INDUSTRY FIRST!)

**The Problem**: Jury consultants cost $10,000+ and mock juries are expensive to assemble. Attorneys need to predict how juries will react to their arguments.

**The Solution**: AI-powered jury simulation with 12 diverse jurors who deliberate and reach a verdict!

**What It Does**:
- ✅ **Generates 12 unique jurors** with:
  - Diverse occupations (teacher, engineer, nurse, etc.)
  - Different ages (25-75)
  - Varied education levels
  - Unique backgrounds and biases
  - Realistic avatars
- ✅ **Simulates jury deliberation**:
  - Jurors debate in character
  - Opinions shift during discussion
  - 8-12 exchanges showing realistic debate
  - Animated delivery (2 seconds between statements)
- ✅ **Predicts verdict** using Gemini 3 Pro with deep reasoning:
  - Guilty / Not Guilty / Hung Jury
  - Vote tally (e.g., 9-3 guilty)
  - Confidence percentage
  - Detailed reasoning
- ✅ **Identifies case weaknesses** the jury noticed
- ✅ **Highlights case strengths** that resonated
- ✅ **Uses your actual arguments**: Enter your opening statement and closing argument, and the AI jury evaluates them

**How to Use**:
1. Go to **Mock Jury** (new sidebar menu item)
2. Select a case
3. Review the 12 randomly-generated jurors (occupations, biases, backgrounds)
4. Enter your **Opening Statement**
5. Enter your **Closing Argument**
6. Click **Start Jury Deliberation**
7. Watch jurors debate your case in real-time
8. See the final verdict with reasoning and case analysis

**Juror Examples**:
- **James Smith** (Teacher, 42) - Values education, structured thinking
- **Maria Johnson** (Nurse, 35) - Compassionate, understands medical evidence
- **Robert Williams** (Engineer, 50) - Analytical, data-driven, skeptical
- **Jennifer Brown** (Social Worker, 38) - Empathetic to disadvantaged
- **Michael Garcia** (IT Consultant, 29) - Tech-savvy, understands digital evidence

**AI Models Used**:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash - Generates realistic deliberation exchanges
- Gemini 3 Pro (thinking mode) - Deep reasoning for verdict prediction

**Why This Is Revolutionary**:
- **No competitor has this feature**
- Costs $0 vs. $10,000+ for real jury consultants
- Test multiple argument strategies quickly
- Identify weaknesses before trial
- Practice responses to jury concerns

**Files Created**:
- `components/MockJury.tsx` - Complete jury simulation
- `types.ts` - Added `Juror`, `JuryDeliberation`, `JuryVerdict` interfaces

### 3. ✅ Persistent Storage (CRITICAL FIX!)

**The Problem**: All data was lost on page refresh. Users couldn't actually use the app.

**The Solution**: Automatic saving to browser localStorage!

**What It Does**:
- ✅ **Auto-saves cases** on every change
- ✅ **Remembers active case** between sessions
- ✅ **Stores trial sessions** (up to 50 recent)
- ✅ **Persists user preferences** (theme, profile, auto-save setting)
- ✅ **Monitors storage usage** with visual progress bar
- ✅ **Export/import data** as JSON for backup
- ✅ **Version management** for future schema migrations
- ✅ **Clear all data** option with double confirmation

**How It Works**:
- Uses React `useEffect` hooks to save on state changes
- Loads data on app initialization
- Stores as JSON in `localStorage` (5MB limit)
- No backend required!

**New Settings Features**:
1. **Storage Management**:
   - Real-time usage display (KB used / KB available)
   - Color-coded progress bar (green/yellow/red)
   - Cases count
   - Export to JSON
   - Import from JSON backup
   - Clear all data button

2. **Auto-Save Toggle**:
   - Enable/disable persistent storage
   - Visual on/off switch
   - Saves preference immediately

3. **User Profile** (now functional):
   - Edit display name
   - Edit title
   - Saves to localStorage

4. **Theme Switcher** (UI ready):
   - Dark/Light mode selector
   - Saves preference
   - (Light theme CSS coming soon)

**Files Created**:
- `utils/storage.ts` - Centralized storage utilities
- Modified `App.tsx` - Added useEffect hooks for persistence
- Modified `Settings.tsx` - Fully functional settings
